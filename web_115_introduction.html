<li><em>Personal Background:</em> I am a graduate of Appalachian State and I received my degree in Healthcare administration. Since gradutating though I have not found the jobs that I want. I feel like my degree is a bit useless as I have worked in Sales and customer service since then. I like to cook, play chess, read a little bit and explore the city when I can find some people to join me. </li>
<li><em>Professional Background:</em> I have worked in sales and customer service since graduating college. I am working towards getting a certificate through cpcc and then will attempt to transition into the tech field. Experience really is everything, if I only have experience in customer service and sales then I need to move on because I think I have hit my limit with the negative energy in these call centers.</li>
<li><em>Academic Background:</em> I went to Providence High school and graduated in 2011. After that I went to Appalachian State University and graduated in 2015 with a degree in Healthcare Administration.</li>
<li><em>My primary computer platform</em> is an Acer PC. I am currently running Windows 10 Pro. </li>
<li><em>Course I am taking & Why:</em></li>
<li>I am only taking WEB 115 this semester and that is because this course will help me get a Javascript certification. I have taken two course during a semester before, but with the amount of content in this course I feel that one is okay because I will be overwhelmed with more than this. </li>
<li><em>Something interesting about me:</em>  I have about 70 records and use my record player to play them. I am interested in music and have purchased some music making software, but there is a steep learning curve to using it and being proficient at creating music. One day I will get it down, but that might be in a year or two haha.</li>
